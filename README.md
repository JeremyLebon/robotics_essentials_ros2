# Robotics Essentials ROS 2

Welcome to an open-source repository that contains materials and exercises needed 
to learn essential robotics skills using ROS 2. 

This material is implemented for the 2024 iteration of the Master's level "Robotics & XR" course taught by 
[Dr. Ilkka Jormanainen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ilkka-jormanainen-5954441/) at the [University of Eastern Finland](https://www.uef.fi/en), in collaboration with [Henki Robotics](https://henkirobotics.com/).
